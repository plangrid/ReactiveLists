### Breaking

- Removed `TableSectionViewModel.collapsed` ([#121](https://github.com/plangrid/ReactiveLists/pull/121), [@jessesquires](https://github.com/jessesquires))

- Removed undocumented initializers for `CollectionSectionViewModel` (the ones that received `headerHeight:` and/or `footerHeight:`) ([#123](https://github.com/plangrid/ReactiveLists/pull/123), [@jessesquires](https://github.com/jessesquires))

### Fixed

- Fixed incorrect calculation for `TableViewModel.isEmpty`. It now correctly returns true only if all sections return `true` for `isEmpty`. ([#123](https://github.com/plangrid/ReactiveLists/pull/123), [@jessesquires](https://github.com/jessesquires))

### New

- Added `CollectionSectionViewModel.isEmpty` property ([#123](https://github.com/plangrid/ReactiveLists/pull/123), [@jessesquires](https://github.com/jessesquires))

- Added `CollectionViewModel.isEmpty` property ([#123](https://github.com/plangrid/ReactiveLists/pull/123), [@jessesquires](https://github.com/jessesquires))

### Changed

- Section and cell view models are now diffable by default. ([#119](https://github.com/plangrid/ReactiveLists/pull/119), [@jessesquires](https://github.com/jessesquires))
Each provide default values for `diffingKey`, but you can customize them for your own needs or opt-out of automatic diffing.
